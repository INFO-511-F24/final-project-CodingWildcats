Strokes can be a deadly medical condition, and even if the patient survives there can be life long consequences as a result of the stroke.\n\n-   This is why we wanted to look into a dataset that may allow us to help predict the risk factors that cause a stroke.\n\n## Dataset\n\n-   The dataset used is from a study published in China in 2020.\n-   It represents a case group of individuals who had a stroke, and a control group of those who did not.\n\n## Data\n\n-   Observations include age, gender, marital status, and employment status, as well as medical information such as BMI, glucose levels, smoking history, etc.\n\n::: {#loaddata .cell execution_count=4}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n      id  gender   age  hypertension  heart_disease ever_married  \\\n0   9046

not suffer from stroke as compared to those who do suffer from stroke.\n\n![](images/stroke.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n## Visualization for Gender Distribution\n\n-   As for gender analysis, there is a higher proportion of females as compared to males surveyed.\n\n![](images/gender.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n## Visualization for Residence Type Distribution\n\n-   In terms of residence type, the distribution for rural vs urban are highly equivalent.\n\n![](images/residence.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n## Visualization for Marital Status Distribution\n\n-   As for marital status, there is a higher proportion of people surveyed who are married, as compared to those who are not married.\n\n![](images/marital_status.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n## Visualization for Work Type Distribution\n\n-   As for the distribution for work type across the population, a majority of the people surveyed worked in private, with lesser distribution of the population working as self-employed, looking after children, or working government jobs.\n-   There is a small proportion of the population who have never worked.\n\n![](images/work_type.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n## Visualization for Smoking Status Distribution\n\n-   While for the distribution of smoking status, there is a higher proportion of the population who have never smoked.\n-   Followed by a smaller proportion of the population with smoking status being unknown and formerly smoked.\n-   Only about 15% of the population surveyed smokes.\n\n![](images/smoking.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n# **Methods and Results**\n\n## Exploratory Data Analysis\n\n-   Missing values were dropped from the dataset.\n-   Categorical variables were transformed into factors.\n\n![](images/proportion_of_missing_values.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n## Variable Correlation Heatmap\n\n-   The correlation matrix of all variables, other the ID, is displayed on the heatmap.\n\n![](images/variable_correlation_heatmap.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n## **Machine Learning**\n\n-   After preparing the dataset, we split it into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.\n-   We trained 5 different machine learning models on this dataset: Random Forest, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Logistic Regression.\n-   To evaluate the performance of these models, we employed 5-fold cross-validation.\n\n## **Results**\n\n![](images/model_performance.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n## **Analysis of results**\n\n-   Random Forest model achieved the highest average accuracy at 96.05%, which was matched by Logistic Regression.\n-   Support Vector Machine and Artificial Neural Network followed closely, with average accuracies of 96.03% and 95.93%, respectively.\n-   Decision Tree model had the lowest performance, with an average accuracy of 92.21%.\n\n## **Model Performance**\n\n-   Cross-validation allowed us to obtain a more accurate and unbiased assessment of model performance.\n-   Among the models, Random Forest and Logistic Regression showed the best overall performance in terms of both average accuracy and stability.\n-   Support Vector Machine and Artificial Neural Network also performed well but did not outperform Random Forest or Logistic Regression.\n-   The Decision Tree model had the lowest accuracy and was less stable, making it a less desirable choice for this problem.\n\n## **Model Performance Evaluation**\n\n-   If model simplicity, speed, and interpretability are essential, Logistic Regression is an excellent option.\n-   However, if model robustness and predictive power are the priority, Random Forest would be the better choice.\n\n# **Conclusion**\n\n## Summary\n\n-   There was not a particularly strong correlation between the stroke outcome and the covariates listed in the dataset.\n\n-   The strongest correlation to a stroke outcome was with age at 0.23.\n\n-   Other notable correlations to a stroke outcome were hypertension, heart disease and glucose level, all at 0.14.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n-   It appears that the strongest correlations to a stroke outcome occur with participants’ physical properties rather than their demographics or living status.\n-   The model results show that individuals in this dataset could be classified by their stroke outcome based on the covariates age, gender, marital status, and employment status, BMI, glucose levels, and smoking history with a high degree of accuracy.\n-   Since there did not appear to be a particularly strong correlation to any one covariate, it was likely a combination of these factors associated with a stroke outcome.\n\n## Future work\n\n-   To increase the population of people being surveyed as one of the limitations we encountered with this dataset is that there was actually a very small proportion of people who had a stroke compared to those that did not: 4.87% (N=249) of individuals had a stroke, while 95.1% (N=4861) did not.\n\n-   This created an unequal distribution within both the training and testing dataset, which may have artificially boosted the classification accuracy.\n\n## Future work\n\n-   To increase the diversity of the population of people being surveyed as the context upon which the study was conducted was not able to return insights that we could consider to be generalizable across the general public internationally.\n\n-   The dataset was from a study that was conducted in China, with the population studied mainly being the Chinese population. As such, observations gathered from the study would be considered more applicable towards the Asian population instead of the international population. \n\n## **References**\n\n-   2020: Pathan, Muhammad Salman & Zhang, Jianbiao & John, Deepu & Nag, Avishek & Dev, Soumyabrata.
