It represents a case group of individuals who had a stroke, and a control group of those who did not.\n\n-   The dataset has observations including age, gender, marital status, and employment status, as well as medical information such as BMI, glucose levels, smoking history, etc.\n\n::: {#preview_data .cell execution_count=4}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n                 id          age  hypertension  heart_disease  \\\ncount   5110.000000  5110.000000   5110.000000    5110.000000   \nmean   36517.829354    43.226614      0.097456       0.054012   \nstd    21161.721625    22.612647      0.296607       0.226063   \nmin       67.000000     0.080000      0.000000       0.000000   \n25%    17741.250000    25.000000      0.000000       0.000000   \n50%    36932.000000    45.000000      0.000000       0.000000   \n75%    54682.000000    61.000000      0.000000       0.000000   \nmax    72940.000000    82.000000      1.000000       1.000000   \n\n       avg_glucose_level          bmi       stroke  \ncount        5110.000000  4909.000000  5110.000000  \nmean          106.147677    28.893237     0.048728  \nstd            45.283560     7.854067     0.215320  \nmin            55.120000    10.300000     0.000000  \n25%            77.245000    23.500000     0.000000  \n50%            91.885000    28.100000     0.000000  \n75%           114.090000    33.100000     0.000000  \nmax           271.740000    97.600000     1.000000  \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n# Methods and Results\n## EDA\n::::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n-   Missing values were dropped from the dataset and categorical variables (gender, marital status, work type, residence type and smoking status) were transformed into factors. \n:::\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n\n::: {#cell-eda .cell execution_count=5}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](presentation_files/figure-revealjs/eda-output-1.png){#eda width=1490 height=1503}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::\n:::::\n## Machine Learning\n\n\n## Results\n\n::::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n-   Some text\n\n-   goes here\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n\n:::\n:::::\n\n# Conclusions\n\n## Conclusion and Future Work\n\nIf you want to generate a table, make sure it is in the HTML format (instead of Markdown or other formats), e.g.,\n\n\n## References\n\n![Image credit: Danielle Navarro, Percolate.](images/watercolour_sys02_img34_teacup-ocean.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"500\"}\n\n## Math Expressions {.smaller}\n\nYou can write LaTeX math expressions inside a pair of dollar signs, e.g.Â \\$\\\\alpha+\\\\beta\\$ renders $\\alpha + \\beta$. You can use the display style with double dollar signs:\n\n```         \n$$\\bar{X}=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$$\n```\n\n\nLimitations:\n\n1.  The source code of a LaTeX math expression must be in one line, unless it is inside a pair of double dollar signs, in which case the starting `$$` must appear in the very beginning of a line, followed immediately by a non-space character, and the ending `$$` must be at the end of a line, led by a non-space character;\n\n2.  There should not be spaces after the opening `$` or before the closing `$`.\n\n# Wrap up\n\n## Feeling adventurous?\n\n-   You are welcomed to use the default styling of the slides. In fact, that's what I expect majority of you will do. You will differentiate yourself with the content of your presentation.\n\n-   But some of you might want to play around with slide styling. Some solutions for this can be found at https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs.\n\n",
