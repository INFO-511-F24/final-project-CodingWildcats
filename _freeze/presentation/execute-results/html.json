It represents a case group of individuals who had a stroke, and a control group of those who did not.\n\n-   The dataset has observations including age, gender, marital status, and employment status, as well as medical information such as BMI, glucose levels, smoking history, etc.\n\n::: {#preview_data .cell execution_count=4}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n      id  gender   age  hypertension  heart_disease ever_married  \\\n0   9046    Male  67.0             0              1          Yes   \n1  51676  Female  61.0             0              0          Yes   \n2  31112    Male  80.0             0              1          Yes   \n3  60182  Female  49.0             0              0          Yes   \n4   1665  Female  79.0             1              0          Yes   \n\n       work_type Residence_type  avg_glucose_level   bmi   smoking_status  \\\n0        Private          Urban             228.69  36.6  formerly smoked   \n1  Self-employed          Rural             202.21   NaN     never smoked   \n2        Private          Rural             105.92  32.5     never smoked   \n3        Private          Urban             171.23  34.4           smokes   \n4  Self-employed          Rural             174.12  24.0     never smoked   \n\n   stroke  \n0       1  \n1       1  \n2       1  \n3       1  \n4       1  \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n# Methods and Results\n## EDA\n\n::: {#cell-eda .cell execution_count=5}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](presentation_files/figure-revealjs/eda-output-1.png){#eda width=1490 height=1503}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Machine Learning\n\n\n## Results\n\n::::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n-   Some text\n\n-   goes here\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n\n:::\n:::::\n\n# Conclusions\n\n## Conclusion and Future Work\n\nIf you want to generate a table, make sure it is in the HTML format (instead of Markdown or other formats), e.g.,\n\n\n## References\n\n![Image credit: Danielle Navarro, Percolate.](images/watercolour_sys02_img34_teacup-ocean.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"500\"}\n\n## Math Expressions {.smaller}\n\nYou can write LaTeX math expressions inside a pair of dollar signs, e.g.Â \\$\\\\alpha+\\\\beta\\$ renders $\\alpha + \\beta$. You can use the display style with double dollar signs:\n\n```         \n$$\\bar{X}=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$$\n```\n\n\nLimitations:\n\n1.  The source code of a LaTeX math expression must be in one line, unless it is inside a pair of double dollar signs, in which case the starting `$$` must appear in the very beginning of a line, followed immediately by a non-space character, and the ending `$$` must be at the end of a line, led by a non-space character;\n\n2.  There should not be spaces after the opening `$` or before the closing `$`.\n\n# Wrap up\n\n## Feeling adventurous?\n\n-   You are welcomed to use the default styling of the slides. In fact, that's what I expect majority of you will do. You will differentiate yourself with the content of your presentation.\n\n-   But some of you might want to play around with slide styling. Some solutions for this can be found at https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs.\n\n",
