It represents a case group of individuals who had a stroke, and a control group of those who did not.\n\n-   The dataset has observations including age, gender, marital status, and employment status, as well as medical information such as BMI, glucose levels, smoking history, etc.\n\n::: {#89ab6017 .cell execution_count=4}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n      <th></th>\n      <th>id</th>\n      <th>gender</th>\n      <th>age</th>\n      <th>hypertension</th>\n      <th>heart_disease</th>\n      <th>ever_married</th>\n      <th>work_type</th>\n      <th>Residence_type</th>\n      <th>avg_glucose_level</th>\n      <th>bmi</th>\n      <th>smoking_status</th>\n      <th>stroke</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th>0</th>\n      <td>9046</td>\n      <td>Male</td>\n      <td>67.0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>Yes</td>\n      <td>Private</td>\n      <td>Urban</td>\n      <td>228.69</td>\n      <td>36.6</td>\n      <td>formerly smoked</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>1</th>\n      <td>51676</td>\n      <td>Female</td>\n      <td>61.0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>Yes</td>\n      <td>Self-employed</td>\n      <td>Rural</td>\n      <td>202.21</td>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n      <td>never smoked</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>2</th>\n      <td>31112</td>\n      <td>Male</td>\n      <td>80.0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>Yes</td>\n      <td>Private</td>\n      <td>Rural</td>\n      <td>105.92</td>\n      <td>32.5</td>\n      <td>never smoked</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>3</th>\n      <td>60182</td>\n      <td>Female</td>\n      <td>49.0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>Yes</td>\n      <td>Private</td>\n      <td>Urban</td>\n      <td>171.23</td>\n      <td>34.4</td>\n      <td>smokes</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>4</th>\n      <td>1665</td>\n      <td>Female</td>\n      <td>79.0</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>Yes</td>\n      <td>Self-employed</td>\n      <td>Rural</td>\n      <td>174.12</td>\n      <td>24.0</td>\n      <td>never smoked</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n# **Methods and Results**\n\n## EDA\n\n## **Machine Learning**\n\nFor this analysis we created several models, and compared them against each other to see which one performs the best.\n\n# **Conclusions**\n\n## Conclusion and Future work\n\n## **References**\n\n-   2020: Pathan, Muhammad Salman & Zhang, Jianbiao & John, Deepu & Nag, Avishek & Dev, Soumyabrata.
