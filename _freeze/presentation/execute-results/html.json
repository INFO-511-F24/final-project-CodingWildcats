It represents a case group of individuals who had a stroke, and a control group of those who did not.\n\n-   The data set has 12 columns, with observations including demographic information such as age, gender, marital status, and employment status, as well as medical information such as BMI, glucose levels, smoking history, etc.\n\n::: {#a4fd6977 .cell execution_count=4}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n      id  gender   age  hypertension  heart_disease ever_married  \\\n0   9046    Male  67.0             0              1          Yes   \n1  51676  Female  61.0             0              0          Yes   \n2  31112    Male  80.0             0              1          Yes   \n3  60182  Female  49.0             0              0          Yes   \n4   1665  Female  79.0             1              0          Yes   \n\n       work_type Residence_type  avg_glucose_level   bmi   smoking_status  \\\n0        Private          Urban             228.69  36.6  formerly smoked   \n1  Self-employed          Rural             202.21   NaN     never smoked   \n2        Private          Rural             105.92  32.5     never smoked   \n3        Private          Urban             171.23  34.4           smokes   \n4  Self-employed          Rural             174.12  24.0     never smoked   \n\n   stroke  \n0       1  \n1       1  \n2       1  \n3       1  \n4       1  \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Introduce the data\n\nYou can use plain text\n\n## Highlights from EDA\n\n::: {#f7bf9b1b .cell execution_count=5}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n      id  gender   age  hypertension  heart_disease ever_married  \\\n0   9046    Male  67.0             0              1          Yes   \n1  51676  Female  61.0             0              0          Yes   \n2  31112    Male  80.0             0              1          Yes   \n3  60182  Female  49.0             0              0          Yes   \n4   1665  Female  79.0             1              0          Yes   \n\n       work_type Residence_type  avg_glucose_level   bmi   smoking_status  \\\n0        Private          Urban             228.69  36.6  formerly smoked   \n1  Self-employed          Rural             202.21   NaN     never smoked   \n2        Private          Rural             105.92  32.5     never smoked   \n3        Private          Urban             171.23  34.4           smokes   \n4  Self-employed          Rural             174.12  24.0     never smoked   \n\n   stroke  \n0       1  \n1       1  \n2       1  \n3       1  \n4       1  \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Inference/modeling/other analysis\n\n## Conclusion + Future work\n\n## Images\n\n![Image credit: Danielle Navarro, Percolate.](images/watercolour_sys02_img34_teacup-ocean.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"500\"}\n\n",
