It represents a case group of individuals who had a stroke, and a control group of those who did not.\n\n## Data\n\n-   The dataset included observations like age, gender, marital status, and employment status, as well as medical information such as BMI, glucose levels, smoking history, etc.\n\n::: {#loaddata .cell execution_count=4}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n      id  gender   age  hypertension  heart_disease ever_married  \\\n0   9046    Male  67.0             0              1          Yes   \n1  51676  Female  61.0             0              0          Yes   \n2  31112    Male  80.0             0              1          Yes   \n3  60182  Female  49.0             0              0          Yes   \n4   1665  Female  79.0             1              0          Yes   \n\n       work_type Residence_type  avg_glucose_level   bmi   smoking_status  \\\n0        Private          Urban             228.69  36.6  formerly smoked   \n1  Self-employed          Rural             202.21   NaN     never smoked   \n2        Private          Rural             105.92  32.5     never smoked   \n3        Private          Urban             171.23  34.4           smokes   \n4  Self-employed          Rural             174.12  24.0     never smoked   \n\n   stroke  \n0       1  \n1       1  \n2       1  \n3       1  \n4       1  \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Data\n\n-   The dataset includes variables such as gender, smoking status, employment status, and marital status which are qualitative variables.\n-   Other variables such as age, BMI, and glucose index are all quantitative.\n\n::: {#loaddatainfo .cell execution_count=5}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n<class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>\nRangeIndex: 5110 entries, 0 to 5109\nData columns (total 12 columns):\n #   Column             Non-Null Count  Dtype  \n---  ------             --------------  -----  \n 0   id                 5110 non-null   int64  \n 1   gender             5110 non-null   object \n 2   age                5110 non-null   float64\n 3   hypertension       5110 non-null   int64  \n 4   heart_disease      5110 non-null   int64  \n 5   ever_married       5110 non-null   object \n 6   work_type          5110 non-null   object \n 7   Residence_type     5110 non-null   object \n 8   avg_glucose_level  5110 non-null   float64\n 9   bmi                4909 non-null   float64\n 10  smoking_status     5110 non-null   object \n 11  stroke             5110 non-null   int64  \ndtypes: float64(3), int64(4), object(5)\nmemory usage: 479.2+ KB\nNone\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n# **Methods and Results**\n\n## EDA\n\n-   Missing values were dropped from the dataset and categorical variables (gender, marital status, work type, residence type and smoking status) were transformed into factors.\n\n\n\n::: {#plotmissing .cell execution_count=7}\n\n::: {#plotmissing-1 .cell-output .cell-output-display}\n```\n<Figure size 3000x1800 with 0 Axes>\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](presentation_files/figure-revealjs/plotmissing-output-2.png){#plotmissing-2 width=2155 height=1506}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Variable Correlation Heatmap\n\n\n\n::: {#cell-plotcorrelation .cell execution_count=9}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](presentation_files/figure-revealjs/plotcorrelation-output-1.png){#plotcorrelation width=2722 height=2427}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## **Machine Learning**\n\nFor this analysis we created several models, and compared them against each other to see which one performs the best.\n\n## **Results**\n\n# **Conclusions**\n\n## Conclusion and Future work\n\n## **References**\n\n-   2020: Pathan, Muhammad Salman & Zhang, Jianbiao & John, Deepu & Nag, Avishek & Dev, Soumyabrata.
