Project Overview

    Project Description: The purpose of this project is to use Python to perform data analysis on a data set and create visualizations to answer questions about the dataset.
    Expected Deliverables: Exact visualizations and questions will be determined after the dataset has been chosen by a majority vote. Other deliverables include a project writeup (that will include an introduction, methodology, results, and discussion) and a presentation (that will include a title slide, and introduction to the topic and motivation, introduction to the data, highlights from EDA, inferences/modeling/other analysis and conclusions).

Team Goals

    Project Goals: 
    •	Use the visualization skills we learned in this class to create meaningful graphs of our data
    •	Use the data analysis skills we learned in this class to be able to interpret the results of our tests.
    •   Present meaningfully concise and informative answers to our research questions
    Learning Objectives:
    •   Learn more detailed visualization techniques with Python
    •   Utilize modeling to make predictions
    •   Learn more about our datasets and the data collection Process
    •   Learning how make an efficient data cleaning using python
