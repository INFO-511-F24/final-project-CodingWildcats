## Introduction and data

```{python}
#| label: load-dataset
#| message: false
```

For each data set:

- Identify the source of the data.

- State when and how it was originally collected (by the original data curator, not necessarily how you found the data).

- Write a brief description of the observations.

- Address ethical concerns about the data, if any.

Make sure to load the data and use inline code for some of this information.

## Research Question

Your research question should contain at least three variables, and should be a mix of categorical and quantitative variables. When writing a research question, please think about the following:

- What is your target population?

- Is the question original?

- Can the question be answered?

For each data set, include the following:

- A well formulated research question. (You may include more than one research question if you want to receive feedback on different ideas for your project. However, one per data set is required.)

- Statement on why this question is important.

- A description of the research topic along with a concise statement of your hypotheses on this topic.

- Identify the types of variables in your research question. Categorical? Quantitative?

## Glimpse of data

For each data set:

- Place the file containing your data in the data folder of the project repo.

- Use the `.head()` and `.info()` functions to provide a glimpse of the data set.

## Analysis plan

-   A plan for answering each of the questions including the variables involved, variables to be created (if any), external data to be merged in (if any).

1. College Scorecard Dataset

Source: https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/

Data was collected from 1996-2023 by the Department of Education by institutional reporting from U.S. schools.

Observations include geographic data for each school, admission rates, institutional characteristics, enrollment, student aid, costs, and student outcomes.

No ethical concerns are present--data is collected from a department level, not individual and includes schools from across the country.

Research Question:What relationships are there between institutional characteristics and student aid, school spending and student outcomes (graduation rate, degree level, etc)

This question is important because student success is an important factor in determining their success in the workforce, as well as an indicator for future students for the quality of that education.

Variables such as school expenditure, student debt and graduate income are quantitative while variables such as degree type, institution name and city are qualitative.

2. Massachusetts Public Schools 2017 Records

Source: https://profiles.doe.mass.edu/

This data was collected by the Massachusetts Department of Education in 2017 from school reports given by public elementary, middle and high schools.

Observations include enrollment and graduation rates, class sizes, demographic and socioeconomic information of students, classes offered and AP testing records.

No ethical concerns are present.
