# Stroke Prediction with Machine Learning

## Introduction

-   Strokes can be a deadly medical condition, and even if the patient survives there can be life long consequences as a result of the stroke.

-   This is why we wanted to look into a dataset that may allow us to help predict the risk factors that cause a stroke.

## Data

-   The data set used is from a study published in China in 2020. It represents a case group of individuals who had a stroke, and a control group of those who did not.

-   The dataset has observations including age, gender, marital status, and employment status, as well as medical information such as BMI, glucose levels, smoking history, etc.

```{python}
print(stroke.head().to_html())
```

# **Methods and Results**

## EDA

## **Machine Learning**

For this analysis we created several models, and compared them against each other to see which one performs the best.

# **Conclusions**

## Conclusion and Future work
