The dataset used for this project has been modified to be uploaded to GitHub.\nObservations include geographic data for each school, admission rates, institutional characteristics, enrollment, student aid, costs, and student outcomes.\nNo ethical concerns are present–data is collected from a department level, not individual and includes schools from across the country.\nResearch Question: What relationships are there between institutional characteristics and student aid, school spending and student outcomes (graduation rate, degree level, etc)?\nThis question represents an overview of the higher education system and its effectiveness in the United States. We hypothesize that student aid and school spending are correlated with student outcomes.\nThis question is important because student success is an important factor in determining their success in the workforce, as well as an indicator for future students for the quality of that education.\nVariables such as school expenditure, student debt and graduate income are quantitative while variables such as degree type, institution name and city are qualitative."
